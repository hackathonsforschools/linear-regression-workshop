This is a workshop to showcase the way in which a trend line can be calculated
to fit a data set. This trend line can then be used to make predictions.

Making predictions from a data model is a **crucial** part of Artificial
Intelligence and Machine Learning.

## What is linear regression?

Linear regression is a way to explore the relationship between a dependent
variable and an independent one. 

## Explanation of terms:

**Epochs** - the number of times the process is run on the data set, more
repeats results in a more accurate model. An excessive number of repeats
can result in *overfitting*, which means the model is specific to only the
data present, and can not neccesarily make accurate predictions.

**Weight** - the coefficient of a variable in the resulting equation.

**Learning Rate** - the rate at which the gradient of the line is altered.
Setting this too low results in convergence being too slow. Setting it too
high means the changes will be unstable.
